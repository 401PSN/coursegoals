							<h3>How I've  engaged with this course goal</h3>

							<p> As soon as I got my first client at Hyper Island, I started engaging with this course goal, but during the digital transformation module, it was intensified. </p>
							<p>
								Having gone through the first year of Hyper Island, I had already interacted with the goal by attending a lot of lectures and workshops learning how to assess, determine needs, and make informed recommendations to clients. </p>

							<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">

								<figcaption>Briefs I had that I have engaged in this course goal during the first year.</figcaption>
							</figure>

							<figure class="wp-block-pullquote aligncenter">

								<ul>
									<p>By doing so, I have used several different techniques to assess the client and the client's contexts. Some of the tools and methods I've been engaging in understanding my clients and their business in various briefs are:</p>
									<li>Stakeholder analysis</li>
									<li>Kick-off Workshops</li>
									<li>Focus Groups</li>
									<li>Questionnaires</li>
									<li>Surveys</li>
									<li>Product analysis</li>
									<li>Brand Personality Analysis</li>
									<li>Risk Analysis</li>
									<li>Customer Journey</li>
									<li>SWOT analysis</li>
								</ul>

							<h3>Digital transformation - the adidas strategy brief</h3>


<!-- 							<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default alignwide">
								<p>The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible.</p>
								<cite>- Arthur C. Smith</cite>
							</blockquote> -->

							<p>Going into the last module, digital transformation, my team and I were helping Adidas to kick off a new strategy cycle, where they were going away from a strategy working with personas, and putting people in boxes, into a more holistic approach. </p>
							<p>Early in we discussed how to approach this brief. We started by taking a risk analysis during a workshop with Roshanak Fatahian, where we discussed how to deal with these potential problems if they do happen. We documented our discussions so everyone was on the same page, and also addressed some of the issues to the client.
							</p>

							<p>Since we didn't have a clear brief, we understood that there were many ways to approach it. By dividing the research process into three phases: <strong>01. Understanding the business,</strong> <strong>02: Understanding the brand, </strong> and <strong> 03: Understanding the user, </strong> we wished to understand the situation in depth before starting to give recommendations on how they should approach this rollout of the new strategy.</p>

							<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">
								<img src="img/strat.png" alt="">
							</figure>

							<h3>Culture workshop & list of demands
							</h3>


							<p>On a workshop on organisational culture with <strong>Klara Adolphson</strong>, we understood that to be able to give recommendations in regards to strategy, we first needed to make sure that the culture allowed us to make these changes Adidas wanted to create. Thanks to interviews with <strong>Tosca Sepoetro</strong>, Adidas Manager Strategic Insights, we were able to get a lot of answers from the staff around this topic.</p>

							<p>
								After researching the culture and procedures at Adidas, the business as a whole, and the user, in this case with a female gen-z perspective as asked by the client. We went into the define-phase, we put all the insights together. 
							</p>

							<p>A list of demands for our solutions was created before we started to ideate more definitive solutions and recommendations. Later on, in the final process, these three demands also were given as recommendations for how we believed that the strategy should be rolled out internally. </p> 

							<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">
								<img src="img/listofdemands.png" alt=""> <figcaption>List of demands</figcaption>

							<h3>Finding similarities between Gen-Z and Adidas
							</h3>

							<p>
								Moving forward in the process. We found out that there were several similarities between the Adidas culture and the strategy they wanted to implement.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even further, when understanding the user, in this case with a female gen z perspective, we saw that the Adidas internal culture and female gen-z had a lot in common. 
							</p>

								<figcaption> Several similarities were found between adidas & Gen-Z </figcaption>
							</figure>
							
							<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">
								<img src="img/opport.png" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								We presented these similarities to Adidas during the final delivery. Together with what opportunities we believe the insights bring. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Our finding was that if they wanted to bring a more female gen z perspective, a big opportunity would be to embrace and enhance the similarities they already were growing within the company. To do so, we provided Adidas's strategy team with different <strong>How Might We’s</strong> based on pains we both found in the Adidas company culture and internal processes, but also in our target group - gen z.
							</p>
							<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">
								<img src="img/hmw.png" alt="">
							</figure>

							<h3>Our solution and recommendations for the next step</h3>

							<p>
								We also ideated and provided them with two solutions on how to get this strategy out in this Gen-Z way. They wanted ideas and inspirations on how to launch this strategy, so we gave them recommendations in form of two different structures of products that we believe ticked all the three boxes in our list of demands, ACCESSIBLE, STAND OUT, and CONNECTED to the strategy.	
							</p>

							<p>
								We recommended them to create these products, 9 films, and 9 infographics, one for each customer segment, to help and support the employees to embrace the new strategy, and better understand their future customers' wants and needs.
							</p>

							<p>
								By creating prototypes, backing up with a set format, and a clear structure on how to produce each of them, we gave them a blueprint if they wanted to put them into production and make them come to life.
							</p>

							</figure>


							<h3>Refelction</h3>
							<p>
								One of the most valuable things about being at Hyper Island is the close connection to the industry and the fact that we get the chance to work with actual clients on real briefs. No brief has never been the same. I've worked with very direct briefs that almost feel suffocating, and sometimes, like the Adidas brief, you feel very lost, because the brief is not giving you any direction. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Going out in the industry, I will gain more and more confidence in having a process to rely on. In this last Adidas brief, the result turned out to be great, thanks to our approach of not letting an open brief stress us, instead create a process where we let our insights give the direction for the brief.
							</p>

							<p>
								A new insight I got from this brief, by really digging deep and getting an even deeper understanding of a company structure, was how it helped to present our final delivery. When first getting the brief, we thought we were helping the employees in the business units. But thanks to this approach, fully understanding the client and client context, we realised that for us to make the most impact, we needed to present our recommendations to the C-suite. We had found in our research that they were more interested in how solutions affected the long term than the short term. This generated an approach from our side to emphasise our message in how our solution was contributing to the (long term) vision of the company. This, in a wish, to make our recommendation come across.
